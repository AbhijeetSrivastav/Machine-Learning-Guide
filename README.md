<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  For those of you not familiar with Pacman, it's a game where Pacman (the yellow circle with a mouth in the above figure) moves around in a maze and tries to eat as many food pellets (the small white dots) as possible, while avoiding the ghosts (the other two agents with eyes in the above figure). If Pacman eats all the food in a maze, it wins.
</p>

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> :cloud: Overview</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I implemented general search algorithms such as depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms which are used to solve navigation problems in the Pacman world.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<h2 id="getting-started"> :book: Getting Started</h2>

<p>You are able to start the game by typing the following commands in the command line:</p>
<pre><code>$ python pacman.py</code></pre>

<p>You can see the list of all options and their default values via:</p>
<pre><code>$ python pacman.py -h</code></pre>
<i>Note that all of the commands that appear in this project also appear in <code>commands.txt</code>, for easy copying and pasting.</i>

<!-- Requirements -->
<h2 id="requirements"> :nut_and_bolt: Requirements</h2>

<p>All major famous Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries have been used in the projcet. </p>
<p>You can install them either by installing them indivdually as per your requirment using your favourite package mangager. </p>

<pre><code>$ pip install package</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ conda install package</code></pre>


<p>Or you can install all the required packages at once by using this requirements.txt file.</p>
<pre><code>$  pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

<!-- Usage -->
<h2 id="usage"> :bookmark: Usage</h2>

This Machine Learning Guide project is made as collection of several Jupyter Noetbooks that can be used as guide by newbie to get theoratical and practical test of machine learning models or by professional as bolier plate for their project.

Models are present in different models with a dataset to test the model and learn from the outputs. Notebooks contain theory related to model, code implementataion and expaination of implementation.

<!-- Contribution -->
<h2 id="contribution"> :paperclip: Contribution</h2>

The Machine Learning Guide Project is a open source project. I a committed to a fully transparent development process and highly appreciate any contributions. Whether you are helping me fixing bugs, proposing new feature, improving our documentation or spreading the word - we would love to have you as part of this project.

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Model Branch (`git checkout -b model/AmazingModel`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingModel'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin model/AmazingModel`)
5. Open a Pull Request

<!-- Support -->
<h2 id="support"> :sparkling_heart: Support</h2>

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it :-

- Giving proper credit when you use Machine Learning Guide, linking back to it :D
- Starring and sharing the project :rocket:
- [![PayPal Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-00457C?style=flat-square&logo=paypal&logoColor=white)](https://paypal.me/abhijeetsrivastav?locale.x=en_GB) You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:

Thanks! :heart:
